# Digital-to-Analog Converter

## Overview
This repository contains the design, simulation, and physical implementation of a 3-bit R-2R ladder Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). The converter translates 3-bit digital inputs into corresponding analog voltage levels using a precision resistor network and an operational amplifier.
